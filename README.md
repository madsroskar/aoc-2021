# Advent of Code 2021

This repository holds my solutions to the tasks of [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I'm solving them in Common Lisp since I have zero experience with Common Lisp from before, so the code here for sure isn't the right way to do things, but I'm learning as I go. I only have very basic experience with emacs-lisp, which is what led me to think trying out Common Lisp would be a good idea which is a decision that so far I'm really happy with.

An absolutely amazing resource for me so far is the [Common Lisp Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/) ([repo](https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook)). If you're at all curious about trying out Common Lisp, this is absolutely fantastic to have. I've decided to sponsor the maintainer of the project (@vindarel), and will absolutely recommend it to anybody that are newbies to CL like I am.
